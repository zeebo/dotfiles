Be sure to have Sublime Text 2 installed before invoking init.sh
Also have Xcode Tools installed.

init.sh is a terrible hackjob that will probably run things if you have to
run it more than once. So dont.

Installs:
	go
	pip
	subl
	bup
	git configs
	~/.bash_profile
	mysql

DEPENDENCIES:
Xcode Tools
Sublime Text 2
